<h2>About</h2>

<p>
    I'm currently on holiday in Australia. I'm also looking for roles in data science in Amsterdam to start in May. Before my trip I was a PhD student in computational statistics and machine learning at the <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/" target="_blank">STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training</a>, Lancaster University. I worked on scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. My project was in collaboration with the University of Washington.
